# IBKR Superbot

This is a simple example script that uses `yfinance` to fetch options data for selected tickers.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the scanner:

```bash
python scanner.py
```

The script will repeatedly fetch options expiration dates for a few example tickers every minute.
